Introduction
This Python script demonstrates multiple advanced features of Python, ranging from object-oriented programming to functional programming. It combines metaclasses for dynamic class behavior, recursion for problem-solving, closures for maintaining state, and decorators for enhancing functions.

The script also includes methods to demonstrate Fibonacci number generation, factorial calculation, and more.

Key Features
Metaprogramming with Metaclasses
MetaType Metaclass: A custom metaclass that dynamically adds logging behavior to methods in the class. When methods prefixed with _ are defined, they are wrapped to log input parameters, call the original method, and log the result.
Recursion
Fibonacci Sequence: The generate_fibonacci function calculates the Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization to optimize performance.
Factorial Calculation: The recursive_factorial function demonstrates the recursive approach to calculating factorials.
Closures
ClosureExample Class: This class demonstrates the use of closures by creating a counter inside a method. The closure retains its state and can be called multiple times to increment the counter.
Higher-Order Functions
Power Function with Decorator: The power function demonstrates the use of decorators. The decorator logs when the function is called and when it returns, wrapping the power operation (x ** y).
Meta-Evaluation
Meta-Evaluation of Data: The meta_evaluation function processes a list of data, applying a transformation function (e.g., doubling each number) via a high-order function.
Usage
To use this script, simply clone or download the repository and run the Python file. The script will execute various examples and print the results to the console.

Example Run
bash
Copy code
$ python complicated_script.py
Output
bash
Copy code
Fibonacci of 10: 55
Factorial of 5: 120
Calling add with arguments (5, 3) and keyword arguments {}
Result from add: 8
8
Calling subtract with arguments (5, 3) and keyword arguments {}
Result from subtract: 2
2
Closure counter: 1
Closure counter: 2
Wrapper: Calling power
Wrapper: power returned 8
Power function with decorator: 8
Meta-evaluation of complex structure: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Examples
Here are some key examples to understand the behavior of the code:

Fibonacci Sequence
python
Copy code
print("Fibonacci of 10:", generate_fibonacci(10))
This calculates the 10th Fibonacci number using recursion and memoization.

Factorial Calculation
python
Copy code
print("Factorial of 5:", recursive_factorial(5))
This calculates the factorial of 5 using recursion.

Using Metaclass for Dynamic Methods
python
Copy code
complicated_obj = ComplicatedClass()
print(complicated_obj.add(5, 3))  # Logs input and output
print(complicated_obj.subtract(5, 3))  # Logs input and output
The ComplicatedClass dynamically wraps methods to log inputs and outputs, thanks to the MetaType metaclass.

Closure Example
python
Copy code
closure_instance = ClosureExample()
counter_func = closure_instance.closure()
print("Closure counter:", counter_func())  # Outputs 1
print("Closure counter:", counter_func())  # Outputs 2
This demonstrates closures by maintaining a counter state between function calls.

Power Function with Decorator
python
Copy code
print("Power function with decorator:", power(2, 3))  # Logs the function call and result
The power function demonstrates how a decorator can be used to log function calls and results.

Meta-Evaluation
python
Copy code
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = meta_evaluation(data, lambda x: x * 2)
print("Meta-evaluation of complex structure:", result)
This evaluates a transformation function on a list, multiplying each element by 2.
